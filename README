FizzyCalc is an utility that takes coordinate strings in a variety of formats and generates copy-and-paste versions of those coordinates in a variety of other formats. It does high-accuracy distance calculations and projections using the Vicenty Method for calculating distances on an ellipsoid. These calculations are much better than you can obtain from your GPS unit!

2.2.1 - 8/28/2011 Updated a bug where entering garbage in the WAAS pulldown would cause a crash.  I haven't uploaded the built binary because of Xcode/code signing issues and unless I have time to deal with these, will just post the binary to my web site.

As of October 25, 2011, there have been 500 downloads.  Woot!
